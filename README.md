# My self paced path into data science

Hello my name is Alivia Blount and I am an aspiring data scientist. I was studying computer science at the University of California, Davis before I started this self paced learning journey. Last summer as a part of my fellowship with code2040, a partner company coursera offered 1-year paid access to 1900 courses and certifications in data science, computer science and entrepreneurship. With this new toolkit at my disposal, I decided to take a gap year away from school and start to learn industry and job skills through the platform. I have also deeply explored MIT's open courseware classes and have begun working through many of the computational thinking and business analyitcs courses. As I build up the documentation of my work you will be able to more extensibly follow my experiences and learning journey into becoming a data scientist.

I created a github GIST version of my resume, that you can view here and a pdf version that I will include in the repo.

Currently I am working as a data science intern with the micro-investing company acorns and workng independently on a food labeling project. I am using user transaction data to understand the way that customers are spending money in the 'Food & Drink' category. With this understanding I am able to think through ways in which Acorns can help users save money in this area.
